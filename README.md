# The Milky Way

Our home, planet earth, is in the milky way galaxy which is beautiful and huge.

There is so much we know about it yet so little.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.  I'm also excited to learn more about coding in general.
